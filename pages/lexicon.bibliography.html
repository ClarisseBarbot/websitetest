                    <h5>Spectrophotometer </h5>
                    <p>Spectrophotometers are colorimetric instruments used 
                    to capture and evaluate color. As part of a color control program 
                    control program, they are used to specify and communicate 
                    communicate color, while manufacturers use them to monitor color accuracy 
                    accuracy throughout production. Spectrophotometers are 
                    capable of measuring virtually any liquid sample, 
                    plastic, paper, metal or textile, and help to guarantee colour 
                    from design to delivery. There are three different 
                    spectrophotometers. </p>
                   
                <h5>Trichromy </h5>
                    <p>Trichromy is a process for reproducing a very large number of colors 
                    colors from three primary colors. Invented simultaneously 
                    by Charles Cros and Louis Ducos du Hauron, developed by the latter, 
                    it enables photography, cinema and television to be produced in color.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Direct dye </h5>
                    <p>A direct dye or "substantive dye" is a soluble colorant 
                    used in dyeing. It allows direct dyeing of fibers of cellulosic origin. 
                    cellulose fibers. It is a generally inexpensive dye. Some 
                    direct dyes can also be used to dye wool and polyamides with good 
                    good fastnesses </p>
                
                <h5>Continuous/discontinuous dyeing </h5>
                    <p>Diffusion dyeing processes (autoclave, jet, jigger, 
                    etc.) are referred to as "discontinuous dyeing". They require the fabric to be weighed 
                    fabric before placing it in a machine to be dip-dyed for a certain 
                    time. The dye bath contains the amount of water, dye and chemicals 
                    and chemicals required for dyeing. Once the shade has been achieved, the bath is drained and the fabric washed.
                    Continuous dyeing processes enable higher yields to be achieved. 
                    efficiency. The technique works by dyeing through impregnation and spinning 
                    between two rollers</p>
        
                    <h5>Vat dyes </h5>
                    <p>Vat dyes are dyes used in dyeing on cellulose fibers and animal fibers. 
                     and animal fibers; in rare cases, they can also be applied to synthetic yarns. 
                     They are very strong dyes (Grand teint). </p>
         
                 <h5>Metamerism</h5>
                     <p>Metamerism is the ability of a hue to change its appearance according to its 
                         exposure to light. A colored surface inevitably receives 
                         light, we therefore use mainly non-metameric colors.</p>
                 
                 <h5>Migrations</h5>
                     <p>Movement of color after completion of the 
                         dyeing process, from bag to garment, for example. 
                        </p>
