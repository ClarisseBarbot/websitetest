           <h4>Colored textiles are used by all on an everyday basis. They are the garment that we wear,
             but also the textiles in our homes and public spaces (1). Color, if also a design tool for 
             aesthetic purposes, is and has-been primarily a way to extend the lives of the fabric we use,
              making them less sensitive to stains and dirt. (2) Dyeing and coloring processes have, 
              however, proved to be of high environmental impact in terms of energy consumption, water 
              pollution and waste production.

              <br><br>

            With the desire of improving the quality of those colors, the dye industry developed together
            with the discipline of chemistry during the second industrial revolution, participating to
            build the habits and standards over color we inherited. Within this frame of perception was
            built the contemporary expectations of uniformity and solidity of the color on the 
            textile’s surface as well as the desire of an abundance of available color shades and
            perfect reproducibility of the color from one material to the other.(3)

                <br><br>

            
            Before the chemical turn of dye, considered to be in 1856 at the discovery of Mauveine
             by William Henry Perkin (4), dye was produced from mainly organic materials (plants or 
             animals like cochineal). Through chemical dye have been achieved better solidity, diversity 
             and overall control over our color production. However, is still to be answered the issue 
             of sustainability in regard to health and environment as chemical dye is, at the moment, 
             considered as a non-biodegradable finishing process, which could imply, maybe, to question 
             our expectations on what is considered to be a high-quality colorant (5).

             <br><br>

            
            Among those possibilities toward a more sustainable color industry, could be considered 
            again the introduction of natural colorants extracted from plants, for their biodegradable 
            properties. Even though, it has to be considered that since the mid XXth century, the study 
            of those colorants has been reduced to the profit of chemical dyes, meaning that we do not 
            have complete knowledge over the possibilities and constraints of those techniques. Yet, 
            thanks to the long history of this practice, is well known the biodegradability of natural 
            dye and its variability over time, being the reason of its abandon.

            <br><br>

            
            From a design perspective, plant colors also used to mean that the color palette available 
            within a community was constrained by the inhabited ecosystem, implying either trade or 
            territory invasion if you were to desire to extend your available shades, some location being 
            known for their rich colorants like India or South America. Therefore, colors were to reflect
             a territory, its capacities and characteristics through the aesthetic of the craft.
            
             <br><br>

            If, as implied by the automotive designer Mark Gutjahr (5), we were effectively to question 
            the definition of what is a high quality colorant towards a more sustainable perspective, 
            would that shift the set of constraints we are today applying to the colorant industry, and 
            what would be the new constraints for us as designers ? Could we design for non reproducible 
            colors or variable colors over time ? What would designs with a limited color palette linked
             to one specific ecosystem would look like ?
            
             <br><br>

            This project will aim to set biodegradability and resource renewability, and, to some extent,
             carbon emission, as the new first set of constraints regarding color production for textile.
              The goal will be to create possible designs within this new set of constraints, on a local 
              scale, and maybe, reproduce this process in other localities during my PhD. Those
               experiments would also be the occasion to build hypothesis on how a color chart could 
               look like within this new set of constraints.
